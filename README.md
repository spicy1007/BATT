# Backdoor Attack with Transformation-Based Triggers

This is the official implementation of our paper [BATT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01806), accepted by ICASSP, 2023. This research project is developed based on Python 3 and Pytorch, created by [Tong Xu](https://github.com/spicy1007) and [Yiming Li](http://liyiming.tech/)

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure the directory follows:
```File Tree
BATT
â”œâ”€â”€ train
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ batt_r
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ batt_t
â”œâ”€â”€ network
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resnet
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vgg
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cifar10
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GTSRB

```

## Dataset Preparation
Make sure the directory ``data`` follows:
```File Tree
data
â”œâ”€â”€ cifar10  
â”œâ”€â”€ GTSRB
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test
```

## Attack
To train the BATT-R in the paper, run these commands:

CIFAR-10:
```train
python run_batt_r.py
```

## Infected model
Get attacked model in the dictionary 'result':
```File Tree
result
â”œâ”€â”€ attack
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ batt_r_cifar10.pth
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
```
